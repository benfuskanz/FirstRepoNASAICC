# My First and Simple Git Respository
First Github repository per the NASA Python Crash course for summer interns.
This is my first attempt to create a git repository on GitHub.
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository.
I am interested in:
- Creating a branch
- Working on the branch and committing my changes
- Merging the branch to main.
